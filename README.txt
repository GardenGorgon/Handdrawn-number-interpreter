This is our handdrawn number interpreter.

At the very begining of NewDataWrapper there is an annotated_path field
Make sure that annotated path is the name of the file you are going to check for images. (annoted)
Also make sure NewDataWrapper and Magnum Opus and the file you are going to check for images are all in the same directory
Run the Magnum Opus file to begin the testing.
Please allow a generous amount of time to calculate the results.

annoted.txt contains the previously calculated results.

Calculated outputs will be in the predictions.txt file in the image folder. 

Please contact gbousvaros2015@gmail.com or sloungeking@brandeis.edu if you are in need of assistance.
